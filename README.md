# Software-Development-Lifecycle-DriverPass

•	Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?
DriverPass is a project designed to fill the gap between the young prospective drivers that want to take the driver's exam and the students that pass the exam.  The client is DriverPass, a company that wants to build a platform where their customers can create an account, purchase session packages, make an appointment for a driving session, and study materials that are in complience with DMV rules and regulations.   

•	What did you do particularly well?
I did very well on my UML diagrams.  

•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would choose the UML Activity Diagram in which I depicted the scenario of a user trying to log in.  What I did well in this document was the fact that I accounted for the situation in which the user forgets their password and clicks on the "forgot my password" link.  However, I did not account for the situation in which the user, rather than clicking on the link, decides to continuously attempt logging in with the wrong password.  I would revise and improve that document by adding a feature in the diagram that only allows the user a certain amount of login attempts before the account is locked.

•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
When interpreting the user's needs, I basically put myself into the shoes of the user and asked myself what would I need to be able to do if I were the one using this system.  Doind this is important when designing because if the designer pays little attention to the user's needs, they will end up with a produtd that the client cannot use and is therefore unhappy with.  

•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?
In the past, I would just jump into a project and figure out the structure as I went along.  After having been through this course, I now know that in the future when designing software, I will need to map everything out first.  Will need to document all of the expected use cases of the system, the entities that will be involved, the actions and orgnaization of the information invovled, etc.  Only once these documents have been made and the structure designed will I begin the implementation.
